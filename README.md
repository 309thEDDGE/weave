# Weave

Weave is a custom package to facilitate the creation and maintenance of complex data storehouses.

Weave was created from a need to track the lineage of data products derived from multiple sources. 
Therefore, Weave can be used to upload arbitrary data products to a datastore with options to store metadata and 
information about how the data was derived. When Weave is used to upload the data, Weave can then be used to access
the data using pythonic API calls, as well as giving the user easy access to data provenance information.
